# Auto Tower Defense

Auto Tower Defense is a pay-to-learn game that turns into a play-to-earn game once you've mastered the core skills required to be good. Right now, the skill it teaches is Solidity, but this can extend to many other areas in the future.

## Overview

Auto Tower Defense is a mix of a tower defense game and a game of chess, but with 3 additional twists:

1. A tower's underlying components code can be modified by the player using Solidity
2. When a player wins a battle, that battle is saved as an additional possible opponent for future players to face at that level. So, the more players play, the more the game grows
3. Any player can license out any other player's tower component patents, but if the first player earns money in a win, a portion of that winning goes to the player they licensed the patent from
